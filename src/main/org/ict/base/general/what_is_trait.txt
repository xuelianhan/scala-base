A Trait is a concept pre-dominantly used in object-oriented programming,
which can extend the functionality of a class using a set of methods.
Traits are similar in spirit to interfaces in Java programming language.
Unlike a class,
Scala traits cannot be instantiated and have no arguments or parameters.
